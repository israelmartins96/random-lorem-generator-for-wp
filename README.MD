## Getting Started

### Downloading And Using As A Plugin
To use this plugin, you must download from [the releases page](https://github.com/israelmartins96/lorempress-for-wp/releases). With each release, there is an attached zip, named something similar to `lorempress-v1.0.0.zip`. Download the appropriate zip file and then upload into your WordPress site as a normal plugin.

Once installed and activated:
1. Go to wp-admin,
1. Edit the post or page where you want to add the lorem ipsum placeholder paragraph(s), and
1. Insert only the `[lorempress]` shortcode on a new line to add your first lorem ipsum placeholder paragraph.

## Built With
* Vanilla JavaScript. No JavaScript library is used at this time.

## Deployment
This is a WordPress plugin that is hosted on the WordPress.org SVN repo.
There is not currently any automated deployment. Instead, once a release is published on GitHub, that release is manually uploaded to the SVN.

## Contributing
Community made feature requests, patches, localisations, bug reports, and contributions are always welcome and are crucial to ensure LoremPress continues to grow.
