## Getting Started

### Downloading And Using As A Plugin
To use this plugin, you must download from [the releases page](https://github.com/israelmartins96/lorempress-for-wp/releases). With each release, there is an attached zip, named something similar to `lorempress-for-wp_v1.0.0.zip
`. Download the appropriate zip file and then upload into your WordPress site as a normal plugin.

Once installed and activated:
1. Go to wp-admin,
1. Edit the post or page where you want to add the lorem ipsum placeholder paragraph(s), and
1. Insert only the `[lorempress]` shortcode on a new line to add your first lorem ipsum placeholder paragraph.

## Built With

There is not currently any automated deployment. Instead, once a release is published on GitHub, that release is manually uploaded to the SVN.
